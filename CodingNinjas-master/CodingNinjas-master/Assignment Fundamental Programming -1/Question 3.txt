Total Salary
Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
Input format :
Basic salary & Grade (separated by space)
Output Format :
Total Salary
Sample Input 1 :
10000 A
Sample Output 1 :
17600
Sample Input 2 :
4567 B
Sample Output 2 :
8762

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Write your code here
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in).useDelimiter("\\s");
		double basic_sal = sc.nextInt();
		char grade = sc.next().toUpperCase().charAt(0);
		double hra = (20 * basic_sal) / 100;
		double da = (50 * basic_sal) / 100;
		double allow;
		if (grade == 'A') {
			allow = 1700;
		} else if (grade == 'B') {
			allow = 1500;
		} else {
			allow = 1300;
		}
		double pf = (11 * basic_sal) / 100;
		double totalSalary =  (basic_sal + hra + da + allow - pf);
         int finalSalary=(int) Math.round(totalSalary);
System.out.println(finalSalary);
	}
